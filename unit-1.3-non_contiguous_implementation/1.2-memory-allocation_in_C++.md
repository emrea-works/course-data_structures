# Memory Allocation in C++ Page

###### Unit 1: Abstract Data Types and Arrays in C++

Arrays can be implemented so that they do not occupy contiguous memory. The addressing is the same. For instance, `A[r][c]` still addresses the c'th column of the `r`th row of array `A`. However, as we will see later in the course, one can not use the address of `A[0][0]` as the starting point for calculating the address of `A[r][c]`. The reason we use this type of array allocation is to delay allocating memory until it is needed. We can also easily get rid of array rows that contain data no longer needed. This is not possible with arrays allocated using native declaration syntax `<type> A[numRow][numCol]` since that approach allocates an entire block of memory for the array at one time. Read the linked page. Pay special attention to the "Matrix" section. You will notice that individual rows do occupy contiguous memory, but the array itself does not.
