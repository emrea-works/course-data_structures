# Abstract Data Types in C++

###### CS201: Elementary Data Structures / Unit 1: Abstract Data Types and Arrays in C++

## Classes and Objects

A class is a user defined abstract data type that further expands upon the concept of a structure but instead of containing just data, it also includes functions.

In OO parlance, functions within a class are referred to as methods.

The concept of enclosing data and functions together within a single entity is referred to as Encapsulation.

Strictly speaking, as far as the compiler is concerned, the only difference between a structure and a class is that of accessibility (aka visibility). A structure's members are all public by default, whereas a class's members are all private by default. However, it is normal programming convention not to mix the two up and therefore structures are generally used for data (or POD: Plain Old Data), and classes are used for objects.

A class consists of three elements:

- Identity
  - Name for the class
- Attributes
  - Data members
- Methods
  - Function members


  Syntax:
```c++
class identity {
    public:
      //  members;
    private:
      //  members;
    protected:
      //  members;
} objects;

```

Simple Class:


```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Triangle {

public:
  float width;
  float height;

  float area() { return ((width * height) / 2); }
};

int main() {

  Triangle myTriangle;

  myTriangle.width = 5; // member access using the .dot operator
  myTriangle.height = 6;
  cout << "Triangle area: " << myTriangle.area() << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

### Encapsulation

The concept of combining attributes and methods (data and functions), collectively referred to as members, into a single named object / entity.

...

Access to an object's attributes should only be controlled by the object itself, and no other object should directly change an attribute of another object.

This concept is known as data hiding.

This is akin to the black box model. We don't care what goes on inside as long as we get what we want from it, providing we supply the correct information to it.

So as long as the interface stays the same, the internal methods of the object can be changed or improved as/if required.

Reduces complexity and dependencies, so that a change in one place won't require multiple changes elsewhere.

In this example, objectA is instantiated on line 26, we then access its public set method to give values to its private data members, and finally we access those private data members using the public get methods on line 30 `cout << objectA.getFirst() << objectA.getSecond() << endl; `:


```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class MyClass{
  private :
  string first, second;

  public:
  void set(string x, string y){
  first = x;
  second = y;
  }

  string getFirst(){
  return first;
  }

  string getSecond(){
  return second;
  }
};

int main() {

  MyClass objectA;

  objectA.set("Hello, ","World!");

  cout << objectA.getFirst() << objectA.getSecond() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
  private:
    string first, second;

  public:
    void set(string, string);
    string getFirst();
    string getSecond();
}

void MyClass::set(string x, string y) {
  first = x;
  second = y;
}

string MyClass::getFirst() { return first; }
string MyClass::getSecond() { return second; }

int main() {

  MyClass objectA;
  objectA.set("Hello, ", "World!");

  cout << objectA.getFirst() << objectA.getSecond() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

### Interface vs Implementation

This concept focuses upon separating what an object does from how it does it.

This concept goes hand in hand with encapsulation, data hiding and abstraction in providing the foundations for OOP.

Specifically, Interface is the public methods of a class that control how it behaves. Whereas implementation is the actual workings of how it behaves.

For instance, slightly modifying the previous example, the class now simply declares its interfaces within the class declaration.

The implementation has been defined outside of the class declaration, but is associated via the scope resolution operator ::

Thus, this class's interface can be seen on lines 10, 11 and 12, and their according implementations on lines 15, 20 and 24 :


### Abstraction

Abstraction is the concept of focusing on the key elements of an item rather than the unimportant (i.e. pulling out [abstracting] the key features), whilst also hiding the way it's implemented.

Similarly, we can apply this concept to programming to create generic Abstract Data Types (or Abstract Base Classes) and call upon its methods for a specific object according to the (data) type of object.

This allows focus on the "What" not the "How".

The classic example is that of a polygon. We know that it is a shape that has sides and an area. We can declare some abstract information of the shape such as its height and width, and then further refine the shape according to the sub-class to define its area:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Shape{
protected :
  int height, width;
public:
  void set(int, int);
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
  int area() {
  return (height * width);
  }
};

class Triangle : public Shape {
public:
  int area() {
  	return (height * width) / 2;
  }
};

void Shape::set(int x, int y){
  height = x;
  width = y;
}

int main() {

  Rectangle myRect;
  myRect.set(4,5);
  cout << "Rectangle has an area of: " << myRect.area() << endl;

  Triangle myTri;
  myTri.set(4,5);

  cout << "Triangle has an area of: " << myTri.area() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Compile and Run

```
Rectangle has an area of: 20
Triangle has an area of: 10
```

### Access Specifiers

The access specifiers define the level of visibility of a class's members to other objects.

The following keywords are used to define the level of access:

- public
    - public members are accessible any place the object is visible
    - public methods should be the only way to change an object's attributes
    - public members make up an object's public interface
- private
    - private members are accessible only from other members of the same class
        - i.e. once instantiated, only that object
- protected
    - protected members are accessible from other members of the same class and to members of derived classes derived
        - i.e. a child class can also access the protected members of the parent

The general rule is to keep all of your data private and provide public methods to access it. This concept is known as **data hiding**.

**Public Definition:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Triangle {
public:
  float width;
  float height;

  //setters
  void setWidth(float x)  { width = x; }
  void setHeight(float y) { height = y; }
  //getters
  float getWidth()  { return width; }
  float getHeight() { return height; }

  //method
  float area(){
  	return ((width * height) / 2);
  }
};

int main () {

  Triangle myTriangle;

  myTriangle.setWidth(12);
  myTriangle.setHeight(2000);
  myTriangle.height = 10;

  cout << "myTriangle width was set at " << myTriangle.getWidth() << endl;
  cout << "myTriangle height was set at " << myTriangle.getHeight() << endl;
  cout << "myTriangle area: " << myTriangle.area() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

**Private Definition:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Triangle {
private:
  float width;
  float height;

public:
  //setters
  void setWidth(float x) { width = x; }
  void setHeight(float y){ height = y; }
  //getters
  float getWidth()  { return width; }
  float getHeight() { return height; }

  //method
  float area(){
  	return ((width * height) / 2);
  }
};

int main () {

  Triangle myTriangle;

  myTriangle.setWidth(12);
  myTriangle.setHeight(2000);
  //	myTriangle.height = 10; // does not compile, since height is private

  cout << "myTriangle width was set at " << myTriangle.getWidth() << endl;
  cout << "myTriangle height was set at " << myTriangle.getHeight() << endl;
  cout << "myTriangle area: " << myTriangle.area() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

**Protected Definition:**

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shape {
protected:
  float height;
};

class Triangle:Shape {  
  //if no access specifier is declared the default of 'private' is used
private:
  float width;

public:
  //setters
  void setWidth(float x) { width = x; }
  void setHeight(float y){ height = y; }
  //getters
  float getWidth()  { return width; }
  float getHeight() { return height; }

  //method
  float area(){
  	return ((width * height) / 2);
  }
};

int main () {

  Triangle myTriangle;

  myTriangle.setWidth(12);
  myTriangle.setHeight(2000);

  cout << "myTriangle width was set at " << myTriangle.getWidth() << endl;
  cout << "myTriangle height was set at " << myTriangle.getHeight() << endl;
  cout << "myTriangle area: " << myTriangle.area() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

In this overly simplified example, the **height** attribute for the child Triangle class **is derived from the parent Shape class** in which the child is inheriting the protected height data attribute.


### Methods

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Triangle {
private:
  float width;
  float height;

public:
  void setWidth(float);  //setter prototype
  void setHeight(float);
  float getWidth();      //getter prototype
  float getHeight();
  float area();          //method prototype
};

void Triangle::setWidth(float x) { //REMEMBER TO DECLARE RETURN TYPE
  width = x;
}
void Triangle::setHeight(float y){ //REMEMBER TO DECLARE RETURN TYPE
  height = y;
}
float Triangle::getWidth(){        //REMEMBER TO DECLARE RETURN TYPE
  return width;
}
float Triangle::getHeight(){       //REMEMBER TO DECLARE RETURN TYPE
  return height;
}
float Triangle::area(){            //REMEMBER TO DECLARE RETURN TYPE
  return ((width * height) / 2);
}

int main () {

  Triangle myTriangle;

  myTriangle.setWidth(12);
  myTriangle.setHeight(2000);

  cout << "myTriangle width was set at " << myTriangle.getWidth() << endl;
  cout << "myTriangle height was set at " << myTriangle.getHeight() << endl;
  cout << "myTriangle area: " << myTriangle.area() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```


### Constructors

A constructor is a special type of class method that is always called when an object is instantiated.

- Typically used to set initial values for an object.
- A constructor has exactly the same name as the class but has no return type!
- A constructor cannot be explicitly called. It is automatically called when an object is instantiated.

If no constructor is defined, the compiler will automatically provide one for you. This is similar to declaring to a primitive data type (e.g. an int or a char) whereby storage will be allocated but is not initialised.

(Definition of a function inside the class by its own name makes it constructor)

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Triangle {

private:
  float width;
  float height;

public:
  //constructor
  Triangle(){
  	width = 45.45;
  	height = 12.34;
  };

  // overloaded constructor
  Triangle(float x, float y){ //overloaded constructor
    width = x;
    height = y;
  }

  void setWidth(float);
  void setHeight(float);
  float getWidth();
  float getHeight();
  float area();
};

void Triangle::setWidth(float x){width = x;}
void Triangle::setHeight(float y){height = y;}
float Triangle::getWidth(){return width;}
float Triangle::getHeight(){return height;}
float Triangle::area(){return ((width * height) / 2);}

int main () {

  Triangle myTriangle;

  myTriangle.setWidth(12);
  myTriangle.setHeight(2000);

  cout << "myTriangle width was set at " << myTriangle.getWidth() << endl;
  cout << "myTriangle height was set at " << myTriangle.getHeight() << endl;
  cout << "myTriangle area: " << myTriangle.area() << endl;

  Triangle myDefault;
  cout << "myDefault width was set at " << myDefault.getWidth() << endl;
  cout << "myDefault height was set at " << myDefault.getHeight() << endl;
  cout << "myDefault area: " << myDefault.area() << endl;

  return 0;
}
```

Compile and Run:

```
myTriangle width was set at 12
myTriangle height was set at 2000
myTriangle area: 12000
myTriangle width was set at 45.45
myTriangle height was set at 12.34
myTriangle area: 280.427
```


### Destructors

A destructor is another special class method, complimentary to a constructor, that cleans up resources by deleting the contents in the storage used for an object when it goes out of scope, or when the delete keyword is used on an object.

- Has the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde ~
- Has no return data type.
- Takes no arguments.
- Cannot be explicitly called. It is automatically called when the object goes out of scope.

If no destructor is defined, the compiler will automatically provide one for you. However, there might be time when you want to ensure the object has been cleaned, or you might want to carry out a quick exit task such as leaving a message.

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std ;

class SingleValue{

private:
  int myVar;

public:
  SingleValue() ; //constructor prototype

  ~SingleValue() { //destructor
	cout << "See ya later..." << endl ;
}

void setValue(int) ;
  float getValue() ;
} ;

SingleValue::SingleValue(){ //constructor
  myVar = 0 ;
  cout << "Hello, World!" << endl ;
}

void SingleValue::setValue(int x){myVar = x ;}
float SingleValue::getValue(){return myVar ;}

int main () {

  SingleValue myValue ;

  myValue.setValue(42) ;

  cout << "myVar = " << myValue.getValue() << endl ;

  return 0;
}
```

Compile and Run:

```
Hello, World!
myVar = 42
See ya later…
```
