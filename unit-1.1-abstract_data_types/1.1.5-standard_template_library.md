# Standard Template Library

###### CS201: Elementary Data Structures
###### Unit 1: Abstract Data Types and Arrays in C++

This lecture introduces the [C++ Standard Template Library (STL) from 21:08 to 29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7pMi7-wro8). STL is a formal part of the C++ language, and is a set of class templates for many important and commonly-used program components. It is very much worth your while to be familiar and practiced with this library.

## C++ Standart Template Library (STL)

- Containers
	- Iterators
		- Algorithms

{Containers : { Iterators : [Algorithms] } }

```

```c++
// Online C++ compiler to run C++ program online
// #include "Vector.h"
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int  NUM_INTS = 100;

int main() {
    // Vector<int> myVector;
    vector<int> myVector;
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_INTS; i++)
        // myVector.add(i);
        myVector.push_back(i);

    for (int i = 0; i < myVector.size(); i++)
        cout << myVector[i] << endl;

    return 0;
}

```
## STL Map

- Associative container like the CS106 Map.
- Allows any object type as a key.
	- e.g. `map<int, string>` maps `int`s to `string`s.
- Powerful but clunky interface

(Annotations from the speech, summary)

Iterators are designed to look like pointers. So if you want to iterate over a range, you have to have two different iterators. You have to say start here, stop there, keep walking forward until you get there.

The other thing you need to know about the iterators is that they're read/write. So you can actually crawl over a container and update the values with an iterator, something that you cannot do with our libraries.

It's a bit more work. The syntax basically looks like pointer reading and writing, but the result is that they're much more powerful, and they're a lot more flexible. Here's a quick example. I just wrote some code here that uses a vector iterator. The thing to take a look at is this right here.

```c++
// Online C++ compiler to run C++ program online
// #include "Vector.h"
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int  NUM_INTS = 100;

int main() {
    // Vector<int> myVector;
    vector<int> myVector;
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_INTS; i++)
        // myVector.add(i);
        myVector.push_back(i);

    for (vector<int>::iterator itr = myVector.begin();
					itr != myVector.end(); ++itr)
					*itr += 137;

    return 0;
}
```

## STL Algorithms

- Generic functions that work on iterator ranges.
- Examples
	- `binary_search`
	- `transform`
	- `next_permutation`
	- `for_each`
	- `sort`
- Almost 75 algorithms
